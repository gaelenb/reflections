When you initialize a repo it adds the meta data files to the targt folder.

It also makes the target folder the master copy.

It is needed to save the metadata:
	commit history

How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? 
What value does it offer?

The staging area is where you put files or folders that you want in a single
commit.

This differs from the working directory because it is simply local storage
of files you don't want to track or commit. 


It also differs from the repository:
	the repo holds all the files that you have committed and all of the 
changes made to them
	
 
The staging area adds a filter for only tracking changes and committing 
the files that you that you add to it.
	Thus you can choose what is part of a commit
