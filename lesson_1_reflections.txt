Learned how to compare two files from terminal.

Seeing the comparison made it easier to locate where the error was introduced.

new commands: 

 Diff -u oldFile newFile

 //This compares the two files and outputs to the terminal.
	Lines that were added in the newFile have a +
	
	lines that were removed have a -

	The -u makes the terminal’s output easier to read.


?How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You will spend far less time finding a change that breaks something because you have a working copy.

Maybe also see how the code evolves over time.

?When would I want to have a version of my code saved?

Regular intervals would be nice for debugging small things as you are coding, though could cause space issues.

When you are finished making whatever specific change you wanted to make 
i.g.
 version 01.0 for the first save 
 1.01 for regular interval saves
 1.1 for specific modular change.

?Why do vcs like Git allow saving multiple files in one commit?

In programming files can have a single change that effects other files
	This makes it more logical to have one unifying commit
	Files often depend on each other to work
		Keeping them together across saves makes sense.

?How can i use git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows all of the commits 
	git log —-stat gives extra information
		how many changes were made
	who made the commit
	a message describing the change
		

git diff compares two commits 
	shows what was added and what was changed



git checkout id goes here
	make the file you’re using a previous commit


?How VC make me more confident to make changes that could break something?
	
	Can easily go back to previous versions 
	Even if the bug isn’t found before more commits are made, its pretty trivial to find where the bug was introduced 



///////******* IMPORTANT IF I RUN INTO PROBLEMS LATER IN COURSE I MIGHT HAVE TYPED THE 2 FOLLOWING COMMANDS INCORRECTLY***************\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

git config --global push.default upstream
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3


?What do I want to try using Git for?

	Sanity
	website files

Are you watching me?
